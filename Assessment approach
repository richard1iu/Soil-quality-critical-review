1.Define objectives
2.Identify and involve target users
3.Select indicators for targeted soil functions and ecosystem services 
  1.Soil indicators : analytical and/or field methods(pedotransfer functions; high throughput)
  2.Non-soil indicators: plant nutrient status, yield, socio_economic indicators
  3.Site description: climate,topography
4.Establish reference(baseline value) and/or interpretation of indicators
5.Creat interactive soil quality assessment tool

The selec tion of soil quality indicators needs to be based on **mechanistic linkages** between **indicators** and **soil functions** or 
ecosystem services that have sometimes been proposed
